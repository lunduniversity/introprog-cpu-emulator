      <h2>About the Application</h2>
      <p>
        This application emulates a simple computer system, allowing users to
        interact with memory cells and registers and execute basic instructions.
        It aims to demystify how computers operate at a fundamental level by
        demonstrating how binary data can represent both information and
        commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note, however, that this emulator simplifies certain aspects, such as
        memory size and instruction set, to make the core concepts more
        accessible.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Main Window Components</h2>
      <p>
        The main window displays the computer memory on the left and the
        processor's registers at the top right, with execution controls at the
        bottom right for running your programs. See figure below for reference.
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <div>
          <img
            src="figures/main-window-marked-60.png"
            alt="Main window layout"

        <p class="figcaption">Figure: Main window layout</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Memory and registers are displayed as a table with columns for address
        (Addr), name (only for registers), binary value (Value), hexadecimal
        (Hex), decimal (Dec), ASCII representation, and instructions (Instr).
        This table format helps visualize the data and its various
        interpretations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Addr:</strong> The address or index of the memory/register
          cell.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> The identifier for the register.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Value:</strong> The current binary value of the cell, editable
          by users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hex:</strong> Hexadecimal representation of the cell's value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dec:</strong> Decimal representation of the cell's value.
        </li>
        <li><strong>ASCII:</strong> ASCII character equivalent of the data.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Instr:</strong> The instruction and operand, if applicable,
          represented by the cell's value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Execution controls allow you to run your program step-by-step or
        entirely, and to reset it, setting all registers to zero while leaving
        memory unchanged. Program output and error messages appear in a text
        area below the controls.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Navigation and basic editing</h2>
      <p>
        Memory and register cells consists of 8 bits (i.e. one byte), and can be
        edited using your keyboard, quite similar to regular text editors. Both
        the memory and registers has a highlighted bit that indicates a cursor -
        initially the top left bit. Their cursors are separate and can be moved
        independently, but only one is active at a time. Move the active cursor
        through its grid using the keyboard arrow keys or the mouse (left
        click). Switch focus between memory and register cursors using the Tab
        key, or with the mouse by simply clicking on the desired cell. The
        memory can be scrolled vertically with the mouse wheel or the Page
        Up/Down keys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pressing the F key ("flip") will toggle the value of the current cell,
        alternating between 0 and 1. You can also press the 0 and 1 keys to set
        the value directly. By default, the cursor will move to the next bit of
        the cell after editing - although, this can be disabled in the Configure
        menu - and you can press Enter to jump down to the next cell.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mouse can be used to navigate and edit the memory and registers as
        well. Clicking on a cell will move the cursor there, and you can change
        bit values by double or right clicking on the bit you want to change.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Executing Programs</h2>
      <p>
        Programs are sequences of instructions stored in memory cells. These
        instructions are executed by the processor, which reads the memory cells
        sequentially and performs the corresponding operations. To run a
        program, you can either step through it one instruction at a time or run
        it continuously until completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Computers use a special register called the program counter to keep
        track of the current instruction being executed. The program counter
        points to the memory cell that contains the next instruction to be
        executed. When an instruction is executed, the program counter is
        updated to point to the next instruction in memory. BitBuilder
        highlights the memory cell pointed to by the program counter with a
        <span style="border: 2px solid magenta; padding: 0 2px"
          >magenta border</span
        >
        to indicate the current instruction. In addition, all memory and
        register cells that would be affected by the current instruction are
        highlighted with a
        <span style="background-color: #ffd1ff; padding: 0 2px"
          >light magenta shade</span
        >, to show which cells will be read from or written to. After an
        instruction is executed, cells that were modified will be highlighted
        with a
        <span style="background-color: #ffffc8; padding: 0 2px"
          >light yellow shade</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        To step through a program, press the Space bar. This will execute the
        current instruction and move the program counter to the next cell. To
        run the program continuously, press Ctrl+Space. This will continue to
        execute instructions until the program reaches a halt instruction or an
        error occurs. You can pause the execution at any time by pressing the
        Space bar again. Note that the execution speed can be adjusted in the
        Configure menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program's output, and any error messages, will be displayed in the
        text area below the execution controls. You can also reset the program
        by pressing the Reset button, which sets all registers to zero while
        leaving memory unchanged.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>ASCII Table and Instruction Descriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Writing programs on a low-level system such as this can be challenging.
        The additional columns in the memory and register tables shows different
        ways to interpret the binary data, but it is ultimately up to the user
        to understand what the data represents. In addition to this help window,
        there are two additional windows that can provide valuable information
        to assist you in writing programs: the ASCII Table and the Instruction
        Descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>ASCII Table window</i> displays the ASCII character set, which is
        a set of 128 characters that can be represented by 7-bit binary numbers.
        The table shows the characters and their corresponding decimal,
        hexadecimal, and binary values. You can use this window to look up the
        binary values of characters and vice versa, when working with text data
        in your programs. The characters are color-coded to indicate their
        category:
        <span style="background-color: #dcdcdc; padding: 0 2px"
          >gray for control characters</span
        >
        that are not meant to be printed,
        <span style="background-color: #aab4fa; padding: 0 2px"
          >blue for digits</span
        >,
        <span style="background-color: #78e678; padding: 0 2px"
          >green for capital letters</span
        >,
        <span style="background-color: #e69696; padding: 0 2px"
          >red for lowercase letters</span
        >, and
        <span style="background-color: #e6e678; padding: 0 2px"
          >yellow for special characters</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>Instruction Descriptions window</i> provides detailed information
        about each instruction that the processor can execute. It explains the
        operation performed by the instruction and any operands it requires.
        This can help you understand how to write programs that utilize the full
        capabilities of the processor.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can access all additional windows through the Help menu or by using
        the keyboard shortcuts: F1 for this help, F2 for the ASCII Table and F3
        for the Instruction Descriptions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Selecting, Editing and Moving Cells</h2>
      <p>
        The application allows you to select and move cells within the memory
        and register tables. You can select one or more cells by clicking and
        dragging the mouse over the cells you want to select, or by holding the
        Shift key and pressing the up or down arrow keys to extend the
        selection. Selected cells are
        <span style="background-color: #c8ffc8; padding: 0 2px"
          >highlighted in light green</span
        >
        to indicate that they are active. Note that only whole cells can be
        selected, not individual bits, and selected cells cannot be toggled
        (changed between 0 and 1) collectively. They can, however, be copied,
        pasted, or moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a selection is active, you can change the selection itself without
        changing the values. Holding Shift and using the arrow keys will extend
        or shrink the selection, while holding Ctrl and using arrow keys will
        move the selection box. Pressing the Escape key or moving the cursor
        without holding any modifier key will clear the selection. Browse the
        Selection menu for all available options.
      </p>
      <p>
        With an active selection, you can also modify the cell values in a few
        ways. Values can be copied and pasted between cells using the key
        combinations Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, respectively. You can also move the
        selected cells up or down by holding the Alt key and pressing the up or
        down arrow keys. This will shift the cells in the direction of the arrow
        key, moving the other cells accordingly. To clear the selected cells,
        press the Delete key. This will set the values of the selected cells to
        zero. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+Delete to completely remove the
        selected cells, shifting all lower cells up to fill the gap. Browse the
        Edit menu for all available options.
      </p>

      <h3>Note on copy and paste</h3>
      <p>
        Copying cells will copy the binary values of the cells, e.g.
        <span class="code">1010 1010</span>, to the clipboard. For pasting to
        work, the clipboard content must adhere to this format (although, extra
        spaces are ignored). Pasting will overwrite the values of the selected
        cells with the copied values. If the copied values are longer than the
        selection, the values will still be pasted, outside the range of the
        selection. If the copied values are shorter, the additional selected
        cells will remain unchanged. If the pasted values would exceed the
        memory or register size, the excess values will be ignored.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Viewing options</h2>
      <p>
        From the View menu you can toggle the display of the Help, ASCII Table
        and Instruction Descriptions windows. You can also adjust the font size
        used in the application. Pressing Ctrl and Plus, Minus or 0 will
        increase, decrease or reset the font size, respectively. When the font
        size is changed, the application will automatically adjust the main
        window size to fit the content. If the ASCII Table or Instruction
        Descriptions windows are open and anchored (see Configuration options
        below), they will also be resized accordingly. The automatic resizing
        can be triggered manually from the View menu as well, or by pressing F5.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Template Programs</h2>
      <p>
        To help you get started with writing programs, the application provides
        a set of template programs that demonstrate various features and
        capabilities of the system. You can access these templates through the
        Template menu, which lists different programs you can load into memory.
        These templates include simple programs that perform arithmetic
        operations, manipulate data, and control program flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        By loading a template program, you can study its structure and
        instructions to understand how to write similar programs. You can also
        modify the template to experiment with different instructions and
        operations. This can be a valuable learning tool to explore the
        capabilities of the system and deepen your understanding of computer
        architecture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Configuration Options</h2>
      <p>
        The Configure menu offers some options to customize the application to
        your preferences. You can toggle the display of the Help, ASCII Table
        and Instruction Descriptions windows on startup. The ASCII Table and the
        Instruction Descriptions windows can be anchored to the main window, so
        they will move and resize together with the main window. You can also
        enable or disable the automatic cursor movement after editing a cell.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Help, Feedback and Support</h2>
      <p>
        If you need help while using the application, you can access this help
        window at any time by pressing the F1 key or via the Help menu. The help
        menu also links to other course resources and the Gitlab repository for
