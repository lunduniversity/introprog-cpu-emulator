      <h2>About the Application</h2>
      <p>
        This application emulates a simple computer system, allowing users to
        interact with memory cells and registers and execute basic instructions.
        It aims to demystify how computers operate at a fundamental level by
        demonstrating how binary data can represent both information and
        commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note, however, that this emulator simplifies certain aspects, such as
        memory size and instruction set, to make the core concepts more
        accessible.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Main Window Components</h2>
      <p>
        The main window displays the computer memory on the left and the
        processor's registers at the top right, with execution controls at the
        bottom right for running your programs. See figure below for reference.
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <div>
          <img
            src="figures/main-window-marked-60.png"
            alt="Main window layout"

        <p class="figcaption">Figure: Main window layout</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Memory and registers are displayed as a table with columns for address
        (Addr), name (only for registers), binary value (Value), hexadecimal
        (Hex), decimal (Dec), ASCII representation, and instructions (Instr).
        This table format helps visualize the data and its various
        interpretations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Addr:</strong> The address or index of the memory/register
          cell.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> The identifier for the register.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Value:</strong> The current binary value of the cell, editable
          by users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hex:</strong> Hexadecimal representation of the cell's value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dec:</strong> Decimal representation of the cell's value.
        </li>
        <li><strong>ASCII:</strong> ASCII character equivalent of the data.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Instr:</strong> The instruction and operand, if applicable,
          represented by the cell's value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Execution controls allow you to run your program step-by-step or
        entirely, and to reset it, setting all registers to zero while leaving
        memory unchanged. Program output and error messages appear in a text
        area below the controls.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Navigation and basic editing</h2>
      <p>
        Memory and register cells consists of 8 bits (i.e. one byte), and can be
        edited using your keyboard, quite similar to regular text editors. Both
        the memory and register area has a cursor, highlighted by a
        <span style="background-color: #91b7e7; padding: 0 2px"
          >light blue shade</span
        >, pointing to a single bit. Switch focus between the memory and
        register cursor using the Tab key. For the memory cells, there is an
        additional
        <span style="background-color: #ffd1ff; padding: 0 2px"
          >light magenta shade</span
        >
        highlighting, showing which cells that would be affected or involved if
        the currently focused memory cell where to be executed as an
        instruction. You can scroll through the memory using the Page Up/Down
        keys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pressing the F key ("flip") will toggle the value of the current cell,
        alternating between 0 and 1. You can also press the 0 and 1 keys to set
        the value directly. By default, the cursor will move to the next bit of
        the cell after editing - although, this can be disabled in the
        Configuration menu - and you can press Enter to jump down to the next
        cell.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mouse can also be used for navigation and editing. Move the cursor
        by clicking on any bit in the memory or registry, and toggle bit values
        by double or right clicking them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Executing Programs</h2>
      <p>
        Programs are sequences of instructions stored in memory cells. These
        instructions are executed by the processor, which reads the memory cells
        sequentially and performs the corresponding operations. To run a program
        in c3pu, you can either step through it one instruction at a time or run
        it continuously until completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like real computers, c3pu use a special register called the program
        counter to keep track of the current instruction being executed. The
        program counter points to the memory cell that contains the next
        instruction to be executed. When an instruction is executed, the program
        counter is updated to point to the next instruction in memory. During
        execution, the
        <span style="background-color: #ffd1ff; padding: 0 2px"
          >light magenta shade</span
        >
        that shows which cells would be affected by an instruction follows the
        program counter rather than the cursor. After an instruction is
        executed, cells that were modified will be highlighted with a
        <span style="background-color: #ffffc8; padding: 0 2px"
          >light yellow shade</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        To step through a program, press the Space bar. This will execute the
        current instruction pointed to by the program counter, and move the
        program counter to the next cell. Some instructions reads additional
        information from the memory, causing the program counter to move
        multiple steps. Holding the Ctrl key while pressing space will
        &quot;run&quot; the program rather than just taking a single step. This
        simply means that the program will continue to be stepped through at a
        fixed rate, until the program reaches a halt instruction or an error
        occurs. You can stop the execution at any time by pressing the Space bar
        again. Aslo note that the execution speed can be adjusted in the
        Configuration menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program's output, and any error messages, will be displayed in the
        text area below the execution controls. You can also reset the program
        by pressing the Reset button, which sets all registers to zero while
        leaving the memory unchanged. That is, your program will remain in
        memory, ready to be executed again.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>ASCII Table and Instruction Descriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Writing programs on a low-level system such as this can be challenging.
        The additional columns in the memory and register tables shows different
        ways to interpret the binary data, but it is ultimately up to the user
        to understand what the data represents. In addition to this help window,
        there are two additional windows that can provide valuable information
        to assist you in writing programs: the ASCII Table and the Instruction
        Descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>ASCII Table window</i> displays the ASCII character set, which is
        a set of 128 characters that can be represented by 7-bit binary numbers.
        The table shows the characters and their corresponding decimal,
        hexadecimal, and binary values. You can use this window to look up the
        binary values of characters and vice versa, when working with text data
        in your programs. The characters are color-coded to indicate their
        category:
        <span style="background-color: #dcdcdc; padding: 0 2px"
          >gray for control characters</span
        >
        that are not meant to be printed,
        <span style="background-color: #aab4fa; padding: 0 2px"
          >blue for digits</span
        >,
        <span style="background-color: #78e678; padding: 0 2px"
          >green for capital letters</span
        >,
        <span style="background-color: #e69696; padding: 0 2px"
          >red for lowercase letters</span
        >, and
        <span style="background-color: #e6e678; padding: 0 2px"
          >yellow for special characters</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>Instruction Descriptions window</i> provides detailed information
        about each instruction that the c3pu processor can execute. It explains
        the operation performed by the instruction and any operands it requires.
        Refer to this window when writing programs, to understand the purpose
        and effect of each instruction, and to make sure you use them correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        All help windows are opened on startup by default, but you can always
        access them through the Help menu or by using the keyboard shortcuts: F1
        for this help, F2 for the ASCII Table and F3 for the Instruction
        Descriptions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Selecting, Editing and Moving Cells</h2>
      <p>
        The application allows you to select and move cells within the memory
        and register tables. You can select one or more cells by clicking and
        dragging the mouse over the cells you want to select, or by holding the
        Shift key and pressing the up or down arrow keys to extend the
        selection. Selected cells are
        <span style="background-color: #c8ffc8; padding: 0 2px"
          >highlighted in light green</span
        >
        to indicate that they are active. Note that only whole cells can be
        selected, not individual bits, and selected cells cannot be toggled
        (changed between 0 and 1) collectively. They can, however, be copied,
        pasted, or moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a selection is active, you can change the selection itself without
        changing the values. Holding Shift and using the arrow keys will extend
        or shrink the selection, while holding Ctrl and using arrow keys will
        move the selection box. Pressing the Escape key or moving the cursor
        without holding any modifier key will clear the selection. Browse the
        Selection menu for all available options.
      </p>
      <p>
        With an active selection, you can also modify the cell values in a few
        ways. Values can be copied and pasted between cells using the key
        combinations Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, respectively. You can also move the
        selected cells up or down by holding the Alt key and pressing the up or
        down arrow keys. This will shift the cells in the direction of the arrow
        key, moving the other cells accordingly. To clear the selected cells,
        i.e. set their values to zero, press the Delete key. Alternatively, you
        can press Ctrl+Delete to completely remove the selected cells, shifting
        all cells below upwards to fill the gap. Browse the Edit menu for all
        available options.
      </p>

      <h3>Note on copy and paste</h3>
      <p>
        Copying cells will only copy the binary values of the cells, e.g.
        <span class="code">1010 1010</span>, to the clipboard. Pasting will
        overwrite the values of the selected cells with the copied values. If
        the copied values are longer than the selection, the values will still
        be pasted, outside the range of the selection. If the copied values are
        shorter, the additional selected cells will remain unchanged. If the
        pasted values would exceed the memory or register size, the excess
        values will be ignored. So long as you adhere to the same format
        (although, spaces are ignored), you can copy and paste to and from other
        sources as well, such as text editors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Viewing options</h2>
      <p>
        From the View menu you can toggle the display of the Help, ASCII Table
        and Instruction Descriptions windows. You can also adjust the font size
        used in the application. Pressing Ctrl and Plus, Minus or 0 will
        increase, decrease or reset the font size, respectively. When the font
        size is changed, the application will automatically adjust the main
        window size to fit the content. If the ASCII Table or Instruction
        Descriptions windows are open and anchored (see Configuration options
        below), they will also be resized accordingly. The automatic resizing
        can be triggered manually from the View menu as well, or by pressing F5.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Example Programs</h2>
      <p>
        To help you get started with writing programs, the application provides
        a set of example programs that demonstrate various features and
        capabilities of the system. You can access these examples through the
        Example menu, which lists different programs you can load into memory.
        These examples include simple programs that perform arithmetic
        operations, manipulate data, and control program flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        By loading an example program, you can study its structure and
        instructions to understand how to write similar programs. You can also
        modify the example to experiment with different instructions and
        operations. This can be a valuable learning tool to explore the
        capabilities of the tool and deepen your understanding of computer
        architecture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Configuration Options</h2>
      <p>
        The Configure menu offers some options to customize the application to
        your preferences. You can toggle the display of the Help, ASCII Table
        and Instruction Descriptions windows on startup. The ASCII Table and the
        Instruction Descriptions windows can be anchored to the main window, so
        they will move and resize together with the main window. You can also
        enable or disable the automatic cursor movement after editing a cell.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
