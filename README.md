## Overview

Welcome to c3pu, a lightweight, simulated computer environment designed to mimic
basic computer operations. Our simulator, named for its playful resemblance to a
certain talkative robot from a certain movie franshise, offers a simple
interface to understand the core concepts of computing, including memory
management, register operations, and basic data processing.

## Features

- Simulated CPU with basic registers.
- Limited memory space for efficient operation learning.
- Interactive program counter to track processing steps.
- User-friendly interface for educational purposes.

## Installation

c3pu is written in Java and does not require any installation. It comes as a
single runnable jar file, meaning that on many systems you can simply
double-click it to run. If that does not work, run it from a terminal, like
this:

```bash
cd directory/where/you/downloaded/the/jar/file
java -jar c3pu.jar
```

Optionally, you can instead clone this repository and build the project
yourself. To do this, start by cloning this project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lunduniversity/introprog-cpu-emulator.git
cd c3pu
```

Then build the project by executing the Gradle build script, like this (it is
not required to install Gradle):

```bash
# on unix-based operating systems (Unix, Linux, MacOS)
./gradlew build

# on Windows
gradlew.bat build
```

## Usage

Here's a quick guide on how to use c3pu:

1. Start the simulator.
2. Load your sample program or use the predefined examples.
3. Execute and observe the behavior of the simulated CPU and memory.

```java
// Code examples can be provided here
```
